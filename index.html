                <p>Taylor Swift's Eras Tour visited five continents, had 149 shows, and spanned nearly 2 years. 
                The setlist included 44 songs and performances from Taylor's prolific career. 
                <br><br>
                Even with such an extensive setlist, Taylor had 100s of songs in her discography to perform. Because of 
                this, she created an acoustic portion of the show that included two unique songs each night, first on the 
                guitar and then the piano. The acoustic songs included album songs not on the usual setlist, 
                mashups of fan favorites and even duets with surprise guests.
                <br><br>
                The "Surprise Song" portion of the show quickly became one of the most loved and watched. Taylor often gave anecdotes 
                before playing songs and slipped in subtle details not in the recored versions. Among the Swifite community, Eras tour
                dates are discussed based on the surprise songs that were played at that show. This page gives Swifties the ability to add
                the songs that were played at their show, and rank the combinations played during the duration of the tour.
