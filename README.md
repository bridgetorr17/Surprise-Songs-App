# Surprise Songs App Frontend

This frontend is hosted at <a href="https://bridgetorr17.github.io/Surprise-Songs-App/">https://bridgetorr17.github.io/Surprise-Songs-App/</a>. 
The interface allows users to interact (`GET`, `POST`, and `PUT`) with a CRUD API that handles request for Surprise Songs played at Taylor Swift's Eras Tour. See the ABOUT popup for a background on Surprise Songs at the Eras Tour. 

## Technologies Uses
- HTML: The app was originally written using .ejs for the frontend content. However, after splitting the frontend and backend into different repositories, I decided to keep the frontend as simple as possible with a barebones HTML/CSS/JS structure.
- CSS: Taylor Swift themed styling with a fully responisve design!
- JS: The client device makes requests to the API via `fetch`. The form is submitted with AJAX to prevent the client from leaving the base get route.
